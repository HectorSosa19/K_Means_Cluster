# **PCA Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**

This project demonstrates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. It covers how to clean, preprocess, and analyze a dataset using Python. Visualizations are provided in both 2D and 3D (if applicable) to explore patterns in the reduced data.

## **Features**
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Standardization of numerical data
- PCA application with explained variance analysis
- Visualizations:
  - 2D scatter plot
  - 3D scatter plot (if 3+ components are available)
  
## **Requirements**
Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
```

## **Project Structure**
```
ðŸ“¦ Your_Project_Root
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ conjunto_datos.csv  # Your dataset goes here
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ venv/PCA    # Main code for PCA and visualizations
```

## **Usage**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HectorSosa19/PCA.git
   cd PCA
   ```

2. **Place your dataset:**
   Add your dataset to the `data` folder and name it `conjunto_datos.csv`. 

3. **Run the code:**
   Execute the Python script to see the results.

   ```bash
   pip3 install jupyter notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Expected Output:**
   - A **2D scatter plot** visualizing the first two principal components.
   - If enough components are available, a **3D scatter plot** will also be generated.

## **Code Overview**

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps implemented in the code:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Fills missing values with column means.
2. **Encoding:** Converts categorical variables to numerical using `get_dummies`.
3. **Standardization:** Uses `StandardScaler` to normalize the data.
4. **PCA Transformation:** Projects the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.
5. **Visualizations:** 
   - 2D Plot for basic pattern exploration.
   - 3D Plot (only if 3 or more components are available).

## **Output Example**

### 2D PCA Visualization:
![2D Scatter Plot](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=2D+PCA+Plot)  
*(Replace with actual image once you run the code.)*

### 3D PCA Visualization (if applicable):
![3D Scatter Plot](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=3D+PCA+Plot)  
*(Replace with actual image once you run the code.)*

## **Interpretation**
- The PCA reduction helps simplify the dataset by keeping only the most meaningful components.
- 2D and 3D visualizations provide insight into potential clusters or patterns in the data.

## **Potential Improvements**
- Use **GridSearch** to optimize the number of components.
- Test with other dimensionality reduction techniques such as **t-SNE** or **LDA**.
- Apply clustering algorithms (like K-means) on the reduced data for further insights.
